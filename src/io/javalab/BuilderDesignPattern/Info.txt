Why We need Builder Design pattern?

1.Class constructor requires lots of field info.
2.Object needs other Objects or parts to construct them.

Builder pattern aims to “Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation
so that the same construction process can create different representations.” It is used to construct
a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object. The process of constructing
an object should be generic so that it can be used to create different representations of the same object.



a builder pattern is more like fluent interface.
A fluent interface is normally implemented by using method cascading (or method chaining).

if you have multiple field and while object creation some of them are optional,better to use builder pattern by method chaining.
