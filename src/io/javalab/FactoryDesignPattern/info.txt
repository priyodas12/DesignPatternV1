# Factory Design Pattern

1.Does not expose instantiation or creation logic.
2.Subclasses creates the object.
3.Common Abstract/Interface.
4.The framework ,the client uses the factories to get object.

# Implementation:
1. Define a factory method inside an interface.
2. Let the subclass implements the above factory method and decide which object to create.
